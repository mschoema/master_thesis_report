### Creating Representations for Complex Moving Geometries in Databases:
### Fixed-shape Moving Regions in MobilityDB

## Abstract

With the information explosion, spatio-temporal data is becoming an increasingly important part of modern society and has many practical applications. This increased use of spatio-temporal data, also called moving object data, fuels the need for open-source moving object databases capable of manipulating several types of moving objects. Moving points being the most used case of moving objects are already handled in current moving object databases, but another domain that previously received some attention in the research still needs to be handled in practice for real-world use. This domain concerns moving regions and is the subject of this master thesis, which describes the different types of moving regions and the recent research in this domain. The main focus of this master thesis is the implementation of fixed-shape moving regions in [MobilityDB](https://github.com/ULB-CoDE-WIT/MobilityDB), an open-source moving object database. To this end, a model for representing the new data type is presented and implemented, together with multiple functions and operators that can be applied to these moving regions. Lastly, possible extensions and topics for future work, linked to the work done in this thesis, are also presented and discussed for their feasibility and importance.
